# Galactic Fleet Website

Currently, this site is built with SvelteKit, with the possibility to migrate to any other framework.
Later this week I will migrate this to Asto.js, which is a static site generator, that lets you build websites
with any UI framework (or multiple all at once).

### Deployment

The site is currently deployed on Vercel, which uses AWS under the hood and its free and easy to use. To acces it, you will need a password.
